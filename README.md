### Designing-a-Data-Intensive-EEG-Application-in-GCP

Final project submission for Big Data Tools class at University of Toronto SCS - Fall 2017. The report was written to demonstrate familiarity with popular big data tools (i.e. Spark, Hadoop, MQTT, etc.) and how they could be used to create a data intensive EEG (brain wave) application using the Google Cloud Platform.

### Application Architecture 

### Data Flow 

### Connect Muse to Cloud 
The MusePython.py library [MusePython.py](https://github.com/mgd1984/Designing-a-Data-Intensive-EEG-Application-in-GCP/blob/master/MusePython.py) provides a way to send Muse EEG data to the cloud over UDP.
