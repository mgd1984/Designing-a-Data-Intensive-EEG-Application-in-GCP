### Designing-a-Data-Intensive-EEG-Application-in-GCP

Final project submission for Big Data Tools class at University of Toronto SCS - Fall 2017. The report was written to demonstrate familiarity with popular big data tools (i.e. Spark, Hadoop, MQTT, etc.) and how they could be used to create a data intensive EEG (brain wave) application using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

See attached [PDF](https://github.com/mgd1984/Designing-a-Data-Intensive-EEG-Application-in-GCP/blob/master/3252%20Final%20Project%20Report%20%E2%80%93%20Designing%20a%20Data%20Intensive%20EEG%20Application.pdf) for full report describing background, methodology, and results. 

### Application Architecture 

### Using MusePython to Send EEG Data to GCP  
The [MusePython.py](https://github.com/mgd1984/Designing-a-Data-Intensive-EEG-Application-in-GCP/blob/master/MusePython.py) library provides a way to send Muse EEG data to the cloud over UDP.

### Use EEGrunt to Analyze EEG Data in the Cloud  

Compatible with the Muse headset, [EEGrunt](https://github.com/curiositry/EEGrunt) is a collection of EEG analysis tools, written in Python. Used to run analysis on streaming EEG data.
